## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox. Entirely.

### What I learned

I essentially used my developed understanding from the last challenge I completed to give myself an easier time working on the desktop->mobile responsive pipeline, as well as taking the time to condense my code so that there wasn't a lot of unnecessary overlap!

I also got to use the filter property on the image for the first time in a while, which was fun to figure out the exact settings I needed to mostly replicate the samples given.

### Continued development

As above - continue consolidating my code into condensed and easy to parse formats while making efficient use of my current knowledge.
